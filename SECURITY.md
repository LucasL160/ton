# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The TON blockchain node software follows a continuous deployment model. Security updates are applied to the **master branch**, which runs on the mainnet. 

We recommend always running the latest version from the master branch to ensure you have all security patches and updates. For testing purposes, the **testnet branch** contains upcoming updates that will be merged to master after thorough testing.

| Branch | Status | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| master | :white_check_mark: Actively supported | Production-ready code running on mainnet with security updates |
| testnet | :warning: Testing | Contains new updates being tested before mainnet deployment |
| older commits | :x: Not supported | Security updates are not backported to older versions |

For production deployments, we strongly recommend staying up-to-date with the master branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please contact our security team at **security@example.com** or use the private **"Report a vulnerability"** feature on our GitHub repository if available.

We aim to acknowledge all vulnerability reports within **3 business days**. You can expect follow‑up updates at least **once every 7 business days** while we investigate and work on a fix.

After receiving your report, we will:
- Confirm receipt and request any additional information we need.
- Triage and assess the impact and severity of the issue.
- Develop, test, and prepare a fix and any necessary mitigations.
- Coordinate a disclosure timeline with you, including when a fix will be released and when the issue can be publicly disclosed.

If we determine that the reported issue is not a security vulnerability or is out of scope, we will explain our reasoning. In all cases, we strive to keep you informed throughout the process.
